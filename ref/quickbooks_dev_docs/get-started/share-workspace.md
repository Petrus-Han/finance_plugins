## Overview

If you need to collaborate with coworkers, you can share your workspace by inviting them to join your team. With a shared workspace, you can collaborate with other programmers, engineers, testers, and marketers as you build your QuickBooks Online app integration and get it ready for customers.

As the workspace owner, you maintain complete control over team privileges and permissions.

## Benefits of a Shared Workspace

- **Efficiency**: The owner, or an admin, can allocate specific work to team members based on their roles and access rights, which brings efficiency and productivity in development and maintenance.
- **Security**: Permissions and role-based access provide better security and confidence that the right people have access to just what they need.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Transitions and ongoing app maintenance are smoother when coworkers leave the company or team.

## Setting Up Your Shared Workspace

As the workspace owner, you have all privileges and permissions and can invite coworkers to be team members. You can add team members at any time.

### Steps to Create a Workspace Team

1. Go to your dashboard (**My Hub > App dashboard**). You will see your apps listed in the **Apps** tab.

2. Select the **Team members** tab.

3. To invite a coworker to the team, select the **Add** button in the upper-right of the screen.

4. Enter the team member's email and role, set the specific permissions you want to grant, and select **Add**.

### Available Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Has all permissions that the owner has, but cannot remove the owner |
| **Developer** | Can access development keys; other access points are protected by permissions |
| **Marketer** | Has access to manage app card listing; other access points are protected by permissions |

### Team Member Status

When you add a coworker, they are added to the team list with a **Pending** status. When they accept their email invitation, their status is updated to **Accepted**.

### Managing Team Members

To resend or cancel an invite, or to edit a member's role or permissions, select **Select an action** in the **Actions** column.
