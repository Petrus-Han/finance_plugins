# Marketing Requirements

Before you can [list your app on the QuickBooks App Store](../list-on-the-app-store.md), it will be reviewed to ensure it meets the following marketing requirements and complies with the [Intuit Developer Terms](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/legal-agreements/intuit-terms-of-service-for-intuit-developer-services). This is in addition to meeting our technical and security requirements.

The marketing review starts once you've informed us that you've remediated any critical, high, and medium security issues found [during your app's security review](security-requirements.md).

This final portion of the app review focuses on marketing. In particular, we focus on [the content of your app card](../list-on-the-app-store/filling-out-your-app-card.md) for each submitted country. Since the content can be different for each country, the marketing review will look at each submitted country's app card individually.

Apps listed on the QuickBooks App Store must continue to meet these requirements after publication. All published apps will be [reviewed by Intuit on an annual basis](../list-on-the-app-store/maintaining-compliance.md), or more frequently at Intuit's discretion, to ensure they continue to meet our required technical and security standards.

> **Note**: The average estimated time it should take for your app to complete marketing review is 5 business days. This can vary if issues are found in your app during the review process.

## App Card Content Standards

[App card content](../list-on-the-app-store/filling-out-your-app-card.md) must meet the following requirements:

- Uses clear, business-appropriate language, and avoids textual, visual, or audio references to other services.
- [Intuit naming and logo guidelines](../list-on-the-app-store/naming-and-logo-guidelines.md) are followed.
- You offer support and your support contact info is correct.
- Site visitors can understand what your app does and its benefits to QuickBooks Online users.
- All links within your app work.
- You can verify any claims made on the app card. For example, if you claim it is "The #1 CRM app," be prepared to share evidence to back it up.
- The text of your website URL cannot contain any Intuit brand or brand element. For example, you cannot use www.quickbooksdeveloper.com, www.qbdeveloper.com nor www.quickdeveloper.com, or any variations thereof.
- Your website cannot contain any Intuit website design elements from any Intuit-owned website, nor any photographs from any Intuit-owned website.
- You may only use the following approved phrase(s) to promote, advertise, market or communicate your relationship with Intuit: "Member: Intuit Developer Program" or "Member of the Intuit Developer Program." You cannot use the terms "Intuit Partner" or any other description other than what is set forth above.
- You cannot state, imply, promote, advertise, market or communicate in any manner that you are a preferred developer for Intuit (or QuickBooks or any other Intuit offering) or are an exclusive developer of Intuit.

## App Pricing

- All apps must have clear and understandable pricing. How you price your app is up to you. Some apps are priced by number of users, some by recurring subscription payments, and some are single-pay.
- You must clearly indicate the currency for your pricing. For example, writing "9.99" as a price is not sufficient, but listing "$9.99" or "9.99 US Dollars" is.
- You do not need to use the local currency for each country where you list. For example, if you're listing in Canada and the US, you may choose to have your pricing only in US dollars for both countries. But the pricing info needs to be clear if this is the case.

---

## Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

- All apps must have links to their company's terms of service and privacy policies.
- Your privacy policy and terms of service must be accessible from a public website, not behind a login gateway.
- It's fine to have your terms of service and privacy policy on the same webpage, but if you do, it's especially user-friendly to link directly to anchor tags for each section.

---

## Image and Video Quality on App Cards

- We strongly recommend you include a video with your app card, but it's not a requirement. If you do include a video, don't use content that doesn't belong to you (music, clips of other media, etc).
- Images and videos should be a high enough resolution to appear clearly on screens of varying sizes. If you're linking to a URL, double-check the URL for errors.

---

## Branding Compliance and References to Competitors' Services

- QuickBooks is a brand and as such, must be written out exactly as it is here, including capitalization.
- Abbreviations such as "QB" or "QBO" are not allowed; please spell out the full brand name.
- You must display the following notice on any materials where the Intuit and/or QuickBooks name is mentioned: "Intuit and QuickBooks are registered trademarks of Intuit Inc. Used with permission."
- You are only permitted to use an Intuit logo to visually depict your application's ability to interoperate and/or synchronize with an Intuit product.
- You may not reference companies in a similar market to Intuit's App Store. If you've submitted your app across multiple markets, please check the content you submit to us for references to other companies.
- Do not show the login procedure for any service other than QuickBooks.
- Do not reference other companies in the audio or visual content of your video or images.
- Do not demonstrate product behavior or walkthroughs using products other than QuickBooks.
