# List Your App on Our Marketplaces

Want to make your app publicly available to millions of QuickBooks Online users?

After [publishing your app](publish-app.md), you can list it on the [QuickBooks App Store](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/app/apps/home/) and in QuickBooks Online. And if you [implement Intuit Single Sign-on](../develop/authentication-and-authorization/single-sign-on-models.md), accountants using QuickBooks Online Accountant can recommend your app to their clients.

Listing your app lets small businesses and potential users find and potentially download your app so it can help run their financial lives. You don't have to list your app, but listing gives you:

- Access to a powerful distribution channel
- Exposure to small businesses looking for industry-specific solutions
- A free landing page where potential users can purchase your app

## Step 1: Learn About Ways We Get Your App in Front of Users

There are two ways to get your app in on our marketplace: an [official QuickBooks App Store](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/app/apps/home/) and the Apps tab in QuickBooks Online. These discovery channels let millions of QuickBooks users find and connect to your app.

The general requirements for listing on the QuickBooks App Store and in QuickBooks Online are the same. However, not all regions have an official QuickBooks App Store. The regions of US, UK, CA, IN and AU allow listing on both QuickBooks App Store and in QuickBooks Online at the same time. However there are also [other countries](list-on-the-app-store/filling-out-your-app-card.md#country-list), where you can list your app and they will be discoverable in the QuickBooks Apps tab.

If you're in a region that doesn't have an official QuickBooks App Store and you don't want your app to appear in QuickBooks Online, [download a country-specific trial of QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/choose-country/) and use it for testing. When your app is ready to launch, use your website and other channels to distribute it directly to users.

## Step 2: Review App Listing Requirements

Make sure your app and the app listing text meet these design requirements:

- [Name and logo guidelines for apps](list-on-the-app-store/naming-and-logo-guidelines.md)
- [Marketing requirements for apps](publish-app/marketing-requirements.md)
- [Search engine marketing and advertising guidelines](market-your-app/search-engine-marketing-and-advertising-guidelines.md)

---

## Step 3: Learn About the App Review Process

Apps need to pass a three part app review before we list them on the QuickBooks App Store. We assess apps for quality, functionality, and branding.

The app review has three parts: a technical review, a security review, and a marketing review. Here are the requirements for each phase:

- [Technical requirements for apps](publish-app/technical-requirements.md)
- [Security requirements for apps](publish-app/security-requirements.md)
- [Marketing requirements for apps](publish-app/marketing-requirements.md)

Remember, if you don't want to list your app to the QuickBooks App Store, you're free to market your app privately and skip the review.

---

## Step 4: Get Your App's Production Credentials

If you haven't already, [publish your app](publish-app.md) so it's live. Then [get your app's production Client ID and Client Secret](../get-started/get-client-id-and-client-secret.md).

---

## Step 5: Complete the App Store Listing Checklist

1. [Sign in](https://developer.intuit.com/dashboard) to your developer account.
2. Select and open the app you want to list.
3. Select **Marketplace** from the left navigation panel.
4. Complete the questionnaire.

Finish any outstanding requirements on the checklist. If you already completed the checklist, you won't see it.

---

## Step 6: Decide if Your App Uses Single Sign-on

If you implement single sign-on when you [set up OAuth 2.0](../develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0.md), decide if you want to [add Intuit Single Sign-on](../develop/authentication-and-authorization/single-sign-on-models.md) at this point.

Single sign-on isn't required for all apps. However, it can make the authorization flow much easier for your end-users.

> **Important**: You need to [implement Intuit Single Sign-on](../develop/authentication-and-authorization/single-sign-on-models.md) if you want your app to appear in QuickBooks Online Accountant. Make sure you select the **Accountant ready** option when you list your app.

---

## Step 7: Check Your App's Production Settings

Make sure your [app's name and logo](../get-started/app-settings.md) look the way you want.

---

## Step 8: Start Listing Your App

1. [Sign in](https://developer.intuit.com/dashboard) to your developer account.
2. Select and open the app you want to list.
3. Select **Marketplace** from the left navigation panel.

If you haven't completed the basic listing requirements yet, this page will be locked. Finish any open tasks on the checklist.

Complete each section and add basic info about your app. This info is what appears on your app page on the QuickBooks App Store or in QuickBooks Online. Learn more [about specific fields and sections](list-on-the-app-store/filling-out-your-app-card.md) if you're not sure what to enter.

---

## Step 9: Fill Out Your App Cards

In addition to general info, you need to fill out certain sections to provide specific info for the countries where you want your app listed.

If you're set up to handle and support connections from many countries, we encourage you to list in as many regions as possible. Keep in mind that the QuickBooks App Store and Apps tab are discovery channels. Consider the following for each country where you plan to list so you can confidently support all of your users:

- Data privacy requirements
- Payment processing requirements and regulation
- Currency rules and conversion
- Tax implications
- Help and support for app users

In the **Tell us where you want to list your app** section, select the specific regions where you want your app to be discoverable in the country-specific App store and the Apps tab. You can also choose to publish your app in other supported countries where your app card can be discoverable for those specific countries (max 5). Localized app card translation is enabled [for select regions](https://help.developer.intuit.com/s/article/Beta-Launch-Localization-for-QuickBooks-App-Marketplace).

Provide accurate info so the right users find your app. This is your chance to impress potential new users. We recommend keeping descriptions clear, concise, and value-driven. Be authentic, stand out, and include whatever you think will help users make the right choice and download your app.

- Tell users what your app does, how it works, and how much it costs.
- Highlight specific features and benefits.
- You don't have to show pricing in all local currencies, but clearly indicate which currency your app uses.

In the **Select what languages your app supports** section, select all of the languages that your app supports. This will be reflected on your app listing and users will be able to filter the App store by language. Here are [a few more recommendations for how to make your app card stand out](list-on-the-app-store/filling-out-your-app-card.md).

> **Tip**: Each country requires its own app card. To save time, when you fill out subsequent app cards, select the **Copy from** dropdown and then a country to copy info from. Then you can simply make edits to the currency or description as needed for each region. We recommend you tailor your marketing and messaging for each regional audience.

## Step 10: Set Up a Testing Environment for Reviewers

Create a test environment with credentials you can share with our review team. Once your app is submitted, we'll use these credentials to run and test your app during the review process.

---

## Step 11: Submit Your App for Review

When your app and app cards are ready to go:

1. [Sign in](https://developer.intuit.com/dashboard) to your developer account.
2. Select and open the app you want to list.
3. Select **Marketplace** from the left navigation panel.
4. Go to the **App listing countries** section.
5. Select **Submit for review**.

Once you submit, we'll begin our technical, security, and marketing review of your app. We'll contact you during each phase of the review. Learn more [about the app review process](list-on-the-app-store/what-to-expect-during-the-review.md).

## Next Steps: Keep Your App Compliant

Be proactive and maintain the technical, security, and marketing integrity of your app. All apps listed on the QuickBooks App Store go through an annual review on the anniversary of publication to ensure they continue to meet Intuit's standards.

Here's how to [maintain compliance year-round](list-on-the-app-store/maintaining-compliance.md) so you'll always be ready for the annual review.
