# Get reviews for your app

We encourage you to promote your app after you [list it on the QuickBooks App Store](/app/developer/qbo/docs/go-live/list-on-the-app-store).

A great way is to ask app users to review and rate your app. Reviews and ratings impact your app's ranking on the QuickBooks App Store. Positive reviews may attract new potential users. Most importantly, it's a chance to connect with users and learn from your users.

Here are tips for getting great app reviews that represent the authentic voice of your users. And, don't forget to check out our [advertising and marketing guidelines](/app/developer/qbo/docs/go-live/market-your-app/search-engine-marketing-and-advertising-guidelines).

## Learn how customer app reviews work

Customer reviews can only be submitted after a company has connected to your app for 90 days. Customers have the option to leave reviews without any comments or text.

Whenever a user submits a review, an objective third-party platform screens them before it's posted. They'll reject any reviews flagged for fraud or inappropriate language. We won't post rejected reviews on your app's QuickBooks App Store page.

If we reject a review, users have the option to rewrite and resubmit it.

In order to preserve the objectivity of our review system, we will not remove negative reviews or low ratings on request from developers.

> **Note on batches of reviews**: We know some developers like to run training sessions for their apps. It's common to ask users to write a review at the end of the session. Be aware that if a batch of reviews is submitted within a short period of time, or from the same computer, our screeners may flag them as fraud and reject them. We encourage you to engage with your users however you like, but consider spacing out reviews.

## Ask users to review your app

The way you approach your users can have a direct impact on their sentiments. Small business owners are very busy. But if you make the process easy for them, many are willing to take the time and write a review.

Let's create a pair of links you can send to users: one that goes to your review tab on the QuickBooks App Store, and another that opens a review form for your app.

- Link to see reviews of your app: `https://apps.intuit.com/app/apps/appdetails?shortName=<permalink to your app>&tab=review`

For example: **https://apps.intuit.com/app/apps/appdetails?shortName=GoPayment&locale=en-us&tab=review**

- Link to open a review form for your app: `https://apps.intuit.com/app/apps/appdetails?shortName=<permalink to your app>&tab=review&checkLogin=true`

For example: **https://appcenter.intuit.com/app/apps/appdetails?shortName=GoPayment&locale=en-us&tab=review&checkLogin=true**

## Learn app review tips and tricks

Here are tips and tricks for getting great app reviews. These guidelines apply to all the content submitted in the review section of your app card, including but not limited to ratings, reviews, recommendations, helpfulness votes, and comments.

### Be engaged: Reach out directly and thank reviewers

Always respond to reviews, both positive and negative. Show users you're listening and you care. Users who take the time to leave reviews appreciate when you answer back. Publicly thank them.

Positive reviewers can become your biggest cheerleaders! Prospective users may be encouraged if they see you respond to negative feedback and engage with reviewers. It's also an opportunity to turn detractors into advocates.

### Be informed: Set up email alerts for new app reviews

Want to get notified whenever there's a new review? [Submit a support ticket](https://help.developer.intuit.com/s/contactsupport) so we can help you set that up.

On the support ticket, select **Apps.com** from the **Product** dropdown and **Email alerts for new reviews** from the **Category** dropdown.

### Be proactive: Respond to reviews and update users

If a user posts a complaint, address it directly. Guide users through negative experiences. Let other users know if there's a widespread problem affecting your platform. Handling issues in a professional manner goes a long way.

Remember, we don't remove negative reviews or low ratings on request from developers. This preserves the objectivity of our review system.

### Be creative: Run contests and sweepstakes

We encourage app developers to simply ask users to write reviews in the right way at the right time.

If you want to further incentivize them, consider running contests or sweepstakes.

## QuickBooks App Store rights

Intuit reserves the right not to post reviews on the QuickBooks App Store website when suspicious activity or potential conflicts of interest could be present such as, but not limited to:

- Invalid email address, including "disposable" addresses.
- Reviews by the developer or employers/employees of the developer.
- Unusually high numbers of submissions by one user.
- Multiple reviews regarding the same transaction. For example, two reviews for the same customer support representative regarding the same issue.

## QuickBooks App Store review incentive policy

Reviewers must not be given a direct financial incentive of any form for writing a review. This includes:

- Free services
- Money
- Other direct compensation

However, potential reviewers may be invited to participate in a giveaway or sweepstakes program. They may be chosen via a lucky draw to receive an incentive for the time spent writing the review. Participation in such a program does not require a disclosure in the review.

Under no circumstances must a prize be tied to the rating of the review. Potential reviewers may be encouraged to write a review, but not to give your app a specific rating.
