# Advertising and search engine marketing guidelines

As a developer with a [published app](/app/developer/qbo/docs/go-live/publish-app) on the [QuickBooks App Store](https://apps.intuit.com/), you may use search advertising networks such as Google AdWords or Yahoo/Bing Ads to promote your app.

If you do, your app must adhere to the following guidelines for keywords and ad copy, and you request approval from Intuit beforehand.

Intuit retains the right to remove any ads that, at Intuit's sole discretion, do not comply with these guidelines.

## General advertising restrictions

Make sure any advertising for your app follows these guidelines:

- All advertisements must clearly display your business name and/or the brand name as the primary element in the ad.
- All ad titles must lead with your own business name or brand, or with an industry descriptor and can't lead with Intuit Brands or brand elements. For example, ads can't use "QuickBooks," "QB," or "Intuit" as the primary element in the ad (e.g., can't say "QuickBooks App" - instead, it must say "XYZ Company – Application for QuickBooks").

## Ad keywords

To trigger search ads for your app that integrates with Intuit products, you may only use Intuit marks, variations, or similar terms as in combination with other descriptive phrases such as "integrates with" or "works with".

Intuit won't approve use of Intuit marks for developers that are not listing their apps on the QuickBooks app store.

**Negative keyword matching**

You must negative match for the following keywords: "**QuickBooks**," "**QuickBooks Online**," "**QB**," and "**QBO**."

**Acceptable keywords**

You may bid on the following keywords only in combination with phrases such as "integrates with" or "works with":

- Intuit

- And any variations including all match types, misspellings, alternate spellings, alternate spacing, or any phrases that include these terms

> **Important**: The use of dynamic keyword insertion to customize any ad text is prohibited.

## Position bidding - Bing Ads

When using Intuit marks in keywords as described above, developers may only bid for 3rd position or lower on Bing Ads. Intuit reserves the right to bid for first and second ad position.

## Ad display domains and URLs

Developers may not use any Intuit marks, variations, or similar terms, including but not limited to the marks listed above, as the display domain in any search ad.

The visible URL of ad can't contain "QuickBooks," "QB," "Intuit," or any other Intuit Brand or brand element before the root domain or within the root domain, or any terms that appear before the ".com".

For example, you can't use "quickbooks.XYZbusinessname.com" or "quickbooksXYZbusiness.com" as your visible URL.

All URLs, including visible URLs in your ads, must comply with the following requirements:

- **Use of Intuit brands as the "direct object" in the URL directory or path is OK**
  - Example of authorized use: "XYZbusinessname.com/AppforQuickBooks"
- **No use of Intuit Brands on a stand-alone basis after the ".com"**
  - Example of prohibited use: "XYZbusinessname.com/QuickBooks"
- **No use of Intuit Brands in front of descriptive or generic terms after the ".com"**
  - Example of prohibited use: "XYZbusinessname.com/QuickBooksApp"
