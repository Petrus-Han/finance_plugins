# Publish and List

> Ready to take your app live?

## Overview

Publish your app after you've thoroughly tested it. This makes it live and functional. You can share the published URL with other developers or users so they can access it, keeping your app semi-private.

- [Publish your app](publish-app.md) so it's active and ready to use.

After publishing, you can also list your app on the QuickBooks App Store to make it publicly available. This lets small businesses and potential users search for your app.

- [List your app on the QuickBooks App Store](list-on-the-app-store.md) and make it available to millions of small businesses.

Keep in mind, there's a thorough three-part review process once you submit your app for listing. It needs to pass all three parts before it shows up in the QuickBooks App Store.
