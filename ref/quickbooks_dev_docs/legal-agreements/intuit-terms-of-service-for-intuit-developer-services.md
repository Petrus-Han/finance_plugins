In the event that you enter into a transaction, or otherwise have an interaction, with a person (natural or entity) or country included in the aforementioned lists, you shall inform Intuit, in writing, within two (2) business days as of the date you learned of such fact or circumstance. Such notice is not intended to relieve, nor will it have the effect of relieving, you of any liability under this Agreement or Applicable Law.

11.4 **Your Representations and Warranties Regarding Global Trade Compliance**. You represent and warrant that you (including any of your Authorized Users, agents, employees, beneficiaries, owners, affiliated and/or associated parties) are not: (i) on any sanctions lists in the countries where the Platform or the Developer Application may be available; (ii) doing business in jurisdictions subject to comprehensive embargoes or comprehensive sanctions, as relevant under Applicable Law, including, but not limited to, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, the regions of Crimea, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, the Donetsk People’s Republic (“DNR”) and the Luhansk People’s Republic (“LNR”) in Ukraine, and Russia; and (iii) a military end user as defined in 15 C.F.R § 744.

You shall not export, re-export, transfer, release or deploy the Platform or a Developer Application, Intuit Intellectual Property, and the like, to (i) any U.S. embargoed countries; (ii) anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (iii) anyone on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons List; or (iv) any other persons, entities or countries on restricted lists of any related jurisdiction or as provided by Applicable Law. You also agree that you will not use the Intuit Developer Platform, the Services, a Developer Application, including any pre-release versions thereof or any Sandbox, for any purposes prohibited by Applicable Law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of nuclear, missile, chemical or biological weapons or any other military end uses.

Intuit, our Affiliates and designated third parties may request documentation verifying your compliance with these standards and Intuit is required to audit, inquire into, or validate your compliance with the same, subject to Applicable Law and you agree to cooperate with any reasonable audits requests from Intuit concerning your compliance with the aforementioned standards.

You understand and acknowledge that in connection with the Developer Application, if Intuit processes any User Data, including Personal Information, on your behalf, Intuit may share such data with its Affiliates anywhere in the world. In such case, you shall notify your Users and obtain their consent where required by Applicable Law, evidence of which shall be provided to Intuit, upon request.

12.4 **Roles Regarding Personal Information**. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, Intuit and Developer shall each independently determine the purposes and means of processing any Personal Information and are independent controllers, and not joint controllers, of Personal Information and, as such, independently determine the purposes and the means of the processing of that Personal Information. Neither Party is required to retain authorization or instruction from the other Party with regard to the processing of Personal Information that it controls. Each Party shall be solely responsible for its compliance with Applicable Law in the processing, sharing, and transferring of Personal Information, including but not limited to (i) ensuring that Personal Information is fairly and lawfully processed, on the basis of one or more legal grounds found in Applicable Law, (ii) the exercise of individual rights by Users, and (iii) matters relating to requests from and other interactions with a regulatory authority. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Intuit shall not be liable, whether jointly or severally, for any compensation, damages, losses, fees, or costs resulting from your processing of User Data, including Personal Information.

12.5 **European Union (EU) Personal Data**. Without limiting the foregoing, if you process “personal data” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and/or the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments, etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (“UK GDPR”), including, any applicable implementing or supplementary national legislation and any successor, amendment or re-enactment (“EU Personal Data”), then the following provisions apply: (i) you will provide reasonable assistance to Intuit where, in Intuit’s judgment, the type of processing of EU Personal Data performed by you is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons (e.g., systematic and extensive profiling, processing sensitive EU Personal Data on a large scale and systematic monitoring on a large scale, or where the processing uses new technologies) and thus requires a data protection impact assessment and/or prior consultation with the relevant data protection authorities; and (ii) if you process EU Personal Data outside of the EU or the United Kingdom (“UK”), as relevant, you will comply with the GDPR with regard to any cross border transfers of EU Personal Data. This may include: (i) processing EU Personal Data only in adequate jurisdictions as defined in the GDPR, to the extent such processing occurs in the United States; or (ii) use of a valid cross-border transfer mechanism as approved by the European Commission.

### 13. SECURITY POLICIES, INCIDENTS AND REMEDIATION

Likewise, your policies and procedures must include measures to detect, prevent, respond to, remediate, and otherwise address any Security Incident.

13.2 **Remediation of Developer Application Disruptions**. You must establish and implement policies and procedures to prevent a Developer Application Disruption. In the event of a Developer Application Disruption, we will attempt to inform you of the same. If you first discover Developer Application Disruption, then you will provide Intuit prompt written notice of the same. In either case you must remediate the Developer Application Disruption using commercially reasonable efforts and within a commercially reasonable timeframe providing Intuit with regular updates regarding the status of your remediation while proactively resolving issues related to User experience, as necessary.

| Medium | 90 Days |
| Low | 1 Year |

13.6 **Security Incident Remediation**. You must take immediate action to investigate and remediate a Security Incident, using your best efforts to remediate any harm caused by it. You will promptly investigate the Security Incident, at your own expense, to identify, prevent and mitigate the effects of any such Security Incident, and carry out any and all remediation necessary. If a Security Incident gives rise to a need, in Intuit’s sole judgment: (i) for you or Intuit to notify Users and/or any regulatory authorities, individuals or other persons, you agree to coordinate with Intuit regarding any such notifications with respect to a Security Incident or (ii) for you or Intuit to undertake other remedial measures in accordance with industry practices and Applicable Law including, without limitation, notice to Users, credit monitoring services, and the establishment of a call center to respond to inquiries (“Remedial Action”). You shall take such Remedial Action at Intuit’s request and direction and at your expense. Any Remedial Action must include notifying Intuit of the actions you are taking to resolve and when the issue is resolved. Further, Intuit shall have the right to issue a Suspension of Access and take any action it deems necessary to protect User Data. You will bear reasonable costs or losses that Intuit may incur directly as the result of a Security Incident. Intuit has the right to investigate any Security Incident and you agree to cooperate fully in such investigation.

13.7 **Security Industry Audit**. If we reasonably believe that a Security Incident or compromise of data has occurred, we may require you, at your expense, to have a competent, industry-recognized third-party auditor that is approved by Intuit conduct a security audit of your systems and facilities and to issue a report to be provided to us or our security providers.

### 14. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

14.1 **Definition of Confidential Information**. Pursuant to this Agreement, a Party (“Disclosing Party”) may disclose to the other Party (“Receiving Party”) orally, in writing, or electronically, or other form or media, non-public confidential information which either has been marked or identified at the time of disclosure as confidential or is proprietary in nature so that the Receiving Party knows or should reasonably know that the information is considered confidential (“Confidential Information”).

For clarity, Confidential Information does not include User Data, which belongs to each User.

14.2 **Duty to Protect Confidential Information**. Each Party shall receive and maintain the Confidential Information of the other Party in confidence and use at least the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event less than reasonable care and shall: (i) protect Confidential Information and prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, reproduction, or use of any Confidential Information; (ii) use Confidential Information solely for the purposes of this Agreement; (iii) restrict access to Confidential Information to its officers, directors, agents, contractors, employees, or representatives who have a need to know such information; (iv) not remove any copyright or trademark notice, or indication of confidentiality on Confidential Information; and (v) not export or re-export any Confidential Information except in compliance with applicable export laws, including without limitation, laws of the United States.

14.5 **Permitted Disclosure**. This Section shall impose no obligation upon the Receiving Party to the extent the Receiving Party can demonstrate and document that the Confidential Information was rightfully: (i) known by the Receiving Party, without restriction, prior to its receipt from the Disclosing Party; (ii) obtained from a third party that had no obligation of confidentiality; (iii) in the public domain through no improper conduct by the Receiving Party; or (iv) independently developed by or for the Receiving Party without access to the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party is permitted to disclose Confidential Information if required by court order, law or regulation, provided however, that the Receiving Party shall give the Disclosing Party written notice promptly upon receipt of such a disclosure requirement before any disclosure is made, if legally permitted, cooperate should the Disclosing Party object to such disclosure, and disclose only the Confidential Information that is required by that court order, law or regulation.

14.6 **Treatment of Confidential Information Upon Specified Event**. Upon the termination, uncured material breach, or expiration of this Agreement, or upon the request of Discloser, the Recipient shall promptly return, destroy or Securely Delete such data and/or materials containing Confidential Information (and any copies, extracts, and summaries thereof) and shall further provide Discloser with written confirmation of secure deletion or destruction upon request, except that the Receiving Party may keep such copies of such Confidential Information for archival and record-keeping purposes as required by Applicable Law.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY WARRANTY PERIOD MANDATED BY STATUTE OR PROVINCE, IF ANY, SHALL BE CONFINED TO THE MINIMUM DURATION LEGALLY ALLOWED. FURTHERMORE, INTUIT, ALONG WITH ITS AFFILIATES AND SUPPLIERS, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT THE USE OF THE INTUIT DEVELOPER PLATFORM WILL FULFILL OR ENSURE ADHERENCE TO ANY LEGAL OBLIGATIONS, LAWS, OR REGULATIONS.

IN CANADA, THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT EXCLUDE, RESTRICT, OR MODIFY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE LEGALLY DISCLAIMED UNDER APPLICABLE CANADIAN LAWS, INCLUDING STATUTORY CONSUMER PROTECTIONS PROVIDED UNDER THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACTS OF RELEVANT PROVINCES.

IN AUSTRALIA, NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT EXCLUDES, RESTRICTS, OR MODIFIES NON-EXCLUDABLE GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW (“ACL”).

### 16. INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Intuit, its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, contractors, subcontractors, partners, equity holders, subsidiaries, licensors, Suppliers, service providers, and their respective assigns from and against all actions, claims, demands, damages, losses, judgments, proceedings, suits, expenses, or costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising from or related to any third-party claims.

This indemnification obligation requires that Intuit provide you with prompt written notice of any third-party claim only when Intuit possesses actual knowledge of such claim.

### 17. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

DESPITE BEING PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND REGARDLESS IF ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, INTUIT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY UNDER ANY CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR UNDER ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, LIQUIDATED, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, OPPORTUNITY OR BUSINESS, ARISING PARTLY OR WHOLLY FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE INTUIT DEVELOPER PLATFORM OR THIS AGREEMENT.

NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL LIMIT LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, FRAUD, OR OTHER WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL NOT AFFECT ANY NON-EXCLUDABLE GUARANTEES AVAILABLE UNDER AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW, OR MANDATORY RIGHTS UNDER APPLICABLE CANADIAN, UNITED KINGDOM OR UNITED STATES LAW. FOR JURISDICTIONS THAT LIMIT CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY, THEN THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL ONLY BE REDUCED TO THE LOWEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LOCAL APPLICABLE LAW.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND REFLECTS A FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK. IF ANY PORTION OF THIS LIMITATION IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE OR INVALID FOR ANY REASON, THE REMAINING PORTIONS SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INTUIT WOULD NOT HAVE ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.

18.3 **Termination for Cause**. Either you or Intuit may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if: (i) the other Party engages in any breach of this Agreement or any unlawful, deceptive or unfair business practice in the course of fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) you or your Developer Application undergo a material change in management, ownership, control, or business operations, including any assignment to creditors, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar proceeding, which Intuit deems unacceptable in relation to the Intuit Developer Platform or Services; (iii) it is reasonably necessary to protect the integrity or availability of the Intuit Developer Platform or systems and comply with applicable Intuit Policy; (iv) your use of the Intuit Developer Platform conflicts with Intuit’s interests or those of another user of the Intuit Developer Platform or Services; or (v) your actions potentially expose Intuit to reputational harm, violation of Applicable Law, liability or obligation. Additionally, Intuit may temporarily suspend access to the Platform or the Services, without notice and without any liability to you, for any of the reasons set out in this paragraph.

18.5 **Effects of Termination**. Upon termination for any reason: (i) you must immediately stop accessing the Intuit Developer Platform and using the Services and immediately cease to make, and remove, any reference to your capability to integrate with the Services, including removing any Intuit Marks; (ii) any outstanding payments will become due; (iii) all licenses granted by us will immediately terminate.

### 19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

19.1 **General Agreement on Good Faith Resolution, Arbitration and Small Claims**. You and Intuit agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to the Intuit Developer Platform, the Services or this Agreement (“Claim(s)”) shall be resolved through binding arbitration or in small claims court, rather than in courts of general jurisdiction, subject to local Applicable Law as provided, below. Before filing a Claim in small claims court or commencing arbitration, but after any notice of a Claim is issued (“Notice of Claim”), both Parties will attempt to resolve the Claim in good faith through an in-person or videoconference meeting. If the Parties do not reach an agreement within sixty (60) days after a Notice of Claim is received, either Party may proceed by filing a Claim for arbitration or in small claims court. If a dispute arises about whether a Claim qualifies for small claims court, this matter shall be resolved by the court, not by an arbitrator. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.

19.2 **Waiver of Class Action and Trial by Jury**. You and Intuit shall bring Claims individually and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. You and Intuit each expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Unless mutually agreed upon by both Parties, the arbitrator will not consolidate any other person’s claims with yours and will not preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

19.3 **No Third-Party Beneficiaries**. For purposes of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, only Intuit’s Affiliates and subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries entitled to enforce this Agreement’s terms against you without requiring their consent to any changes to this Agreement. This Agreement benefits only the signatories, and no other person has any rights, legal or equitable, under this Agreement.

19.4 **Dispute Resolution in the United States**. In addition to the terms provided in this Section 19, the governing laws, governing courts, and applicable dispute resolution processes for the United States, or any jurisdiction not expressly provided for, below, shall be determined solely based on your Developer Account Country and as set forth in the Intuit Contracting Party and Governing Law table, below. Except for disputes qualifying for small claims, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and (to the extent not preempted) the laws of the State of California govern the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision without regard to conflict of laws principles. Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules, which are accessible at www.adr.org. The binding arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, and hearings shall take place in the county of your residence or the mailing address provided in your Notice of Claim. Arbitrators may award the same damages as a court but may not award relief beyond that scope. If you fail to appear at the administrative conference, regardless of whether your counsel attends, the AAA will administratively close the arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless you show good cause as to why you were not able to attend the conference. Claims that fall within the jurisdictional limits of a small claims court may be brought in such courts instead of arbitration.
