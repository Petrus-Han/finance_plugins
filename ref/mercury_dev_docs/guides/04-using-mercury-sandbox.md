# Using the Mercury Sandbox for Testing

Our Sandbox environment is designed to make it easy for you to test API calls in a safe, simulated version of Mercury — no real money involved.

## Step 1: Create a sandbox environment

To get started, you'll need a sandbox environment.

Unlike signing for Mercury, when you log into a sandbox environment, it skips the normal onboarding process. Instead, you'll be dropped into the Home page, which you'll find pre-loaded with dummy data including organizations, accounts, transactions, and account balances to allow testing.

## Step 2: Create an API token in the sandbox environment

Next, you'll need an API token created specifically in the sandbox environment. Go to the sandbox dashboard after signing up.

Create a new API token from the UI. To do this, navigate to your settings and select API Tokens.

> **Important:** Tokens created outside of the sandbox (like in production) won't work here.

## Step 3: Configure your API endpoints for testing

When making API requests, make sure they're pointed to our sandbox base URL: `https://api-sandbox.mercury.com/api/v1/`

Any requests (like creating recipients, sending transactions, etc.) will show up in the sandbox UI, so you can visually confirm what's happening.

**NOTE:** If you're using Sandbox for testing OAuth2 integrations, the base URL is `https://oauth2-sandbox.mercury.com/`

## Quick Recap

1. Use only sandbox-created tokens
2. Direct API calls to `https://api-sandbox.mercury.com/api/v1/`
3. See your test data reflected in the sandbox UI
