# Welcome to Mercury's API docs

Access your accounts, transaction histories, and make payments programmatically with the Mercury API

With the Mercury API, you can access all of your accounts and their transaction histories or make payments to existing recipients.

These docs will cover the available endpoints and provide example code for using the API. They will hopefully help you build your own admin tools or automate processes that previously had to be performed manually.

If you have any questions, just send us an email at api@mercury.com.
